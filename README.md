# Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post-Udacity-Project

In this project I analysed the Seattle Airbnb Dataset.

I used these libraries:
* warnings
* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* sklearn

These are the three questions that interested me and that I investigated in this project:
* Question 1: What prices are most common on Airbnb (top 10)
* Question 2: Does the amount of bedrooms affect the price on Airbnb? does the amount of bathrooms?
* Question 3: In what neighbourhood do the Airbnb places get the best ratings?

For question 1 I found out that the most common price for a house or apartment is 150 dollars, for question 2 I found out that the number of bathrooms and bedrooms does affect the price up to a specific point and last but not least for question 3 I found out that the neighbourhood that got the best ratings was Capital Hill with all their ratings being 100%.

I used stackoverflow many times due to the fact that I always had a question or so that I needed to research more about (for instance how to change an object type to a float and etc.)
